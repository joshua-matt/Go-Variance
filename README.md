# Go-Variance
In this project, I analyze the 18k and 9d subsets of [featurecat's Go dataset](https://github.com/featurecat/go-dataset/tree/master/) to discover how final positions differ between low- and high-ranked amateur Go players. Both of the analyses I perform rely on the covariance matrix of the dataset (hence "Go-Variance"), and we make sense of the analyses through pretty visualizations. Check out [writeup.pdf]() for the whole story!
